The trial of Yevgeny Nagorny and Sergei Stavitsky, accused of 10 proven murders, commenced on [Date] and concluded on [Date]. Throughout the trial, I maintained order and decorum in the courtroom, ensuring that all parties involved adhered to the rules of evidence and procedure.

**Rulings on Evidence and Objections:**

During the trial, counsel for both the prosecution and defense raised several objections and motions regarding the admissibility of evidence. After careful consideration, I ruled on each objection, ensuring that only relevant and admissible evidence was presented to the jury.

Notably, I granted the prosecution's motion to admit forensic evidence linking the defendants to the crime scenes, as well as eyewitness testimony that placed the defendants at the scenes of the murders. Conversely, I sustained the defense's objection to the admission of certain hearsay statements, deeming them unreliable and prejudicial.

**Jury Instructions:**

Prior to deliberation, I provided clear and comprehensive instructions to the jury on the applicable laws and their duty. I explained the elements of the crimes charged, the burden of proof, and the importance of considering only the evidence presented in court.

Specifically, I instructed the jury to consider the following:

* The prosecution must prove the defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt;
* The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty;

Based on these factors, the court sentences the defendants to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

**Judgment:**

Based on the overwhelming evidence presented, the jury's verdict, and the factors considered in sentencing, I find that the defendants, Yevgeny Nagorny and Sergei Stavitsky, are guilty of 10 counts of murder.

Based on the brutality and callousness of the crimes, the defendants' lack of remorse, and the need to protect society, the court sentences the defendants to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

This sentence is fair, just, and reflects the gravity of the crimes committed.
