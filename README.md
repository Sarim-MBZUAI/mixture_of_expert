## 🔢 Data Processing

The script processes data from `serial_killers_data.csv`, containing detailed information about serial killers. A subset of killers is randomly selected for in-depth analysis.

## ⚖️ AI-Powered Court Simulation

Leveraging the CrewAI library, the project simulates a comprehensive court process for each selected killer:

- 👨‍⚖️ **Judge Agent**: Presides over proceedings and delivers final judgments
- 👥 **Jury Agent**: Evaluates evidence and reaches a verdict
- 🕴️ **Executioner Agent**: Outlines steps to carry out the court's decision

## 📝 Report Generation

For each analyzed serial killer, the script generates a detailed Markdown report containing:
- Judge's decision
- Jury's verdict
- Executioner's plan

Reports are saved in the `criminal_reports/` directory.

## 📊 Visualizations

The script generates several insightful visualizations:
1. 🥧 Pie chart of sentence distributions
2. 📊 Bar plot of victim count by killer
3. 📦 Box plot of victim count by sentence

All visualizations are saved in the `figures/` directory.

## 🔗 Dependencies

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- crewai
- langchain_groq
- langchain
- langchain_community

## 🔢 Data Processing

The script processes data from `serial_killers_data.csv`, containing detailed information about serial killers. A subset of killers is randomly selected for in-depth analysis.

## ⚖️ AI-Powered Court Simulation

Leveraging the CrewAI library, the project simulates a comprehensive court process for each selected killer with the following agents:

- 👨‍⚖️ **Presiding Judge**: Maintains order, makes rulings, and delivers sentences
- 👥 **Jury Panel**: Evaluates evidence and reaches a verdict
- 👨‍🏫 **District Attorney**: Presents the case for the prosecution
- 👨‍💼 **Defense Counsel**: Represents the accused and presents the defense

## 📝 Report Generation

For each analyzed serial killer, the script generates detailed individual reports for each role in the court process:
- Presiding Judge's decision
- Jury's verdict
- District Attorney's arguments
- Defense Counsel's strategy

Reports are saved as separate Markdown files in the `criminal_reports/` directory.

## 📊 Visualizations

The script generates several insightful visualizations:
1. 🥧 Pie chart of sentence distributions
2. 📊 Bar plot of victim count by killer
3. 📦 Box plot of victim count by sentence

All visualizations are saved in the `figures/` directory.

## 📜 Logging

The project implements a custom logging system that:
- Creates timestamped log files in the `logs/` directory
- Captures detailed information about the script's execution
- Logs errors, warnings, and important events throughout the process

## 🔗 Dependencies

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- crewai
- langchain_groq
- langchain
- langchain_community
- numpy
