Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, esteemed members of the court, today marks a significant milestone in the pursuit of justice for the victims of Craig Price's heinous crimes. As the prosecutor in this case, it is my duty to present the state's case against the accused, and I am proud to have done so with integrity, fairness, and a commitment to upholding the law.

3. **Physical Evidence:** The discovery of victims' personal belongings in Craig Price's possession, including jewelry and clothing.
4. **Digital Evidence:** Incriminating online searches and communications on Craig Price's devices, revealing a fascination with violence and murder.

**Examination of Witnesses:**
The state called several key witnesses to the stand, including:

I urged the jury to consider the devastating impact of the defendant's actions on the victims' families and the community at large.

**Sentencing Recommendation:**
Given the gravity of Craig Price's crimes, I recommend that he be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This sentence reflects the severity of his offenses and ensures that he will not pose a threat to public safety again.

In conclusion, the state has presented a comprehensive and compelling case against Craig Price, demonstrating his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. I am confident that the jury's verdict is a just one, and I urge the court to impose a sentence that reflects the severity of the defendant's crimes.
