# Presiding Judge Report for Craig Price

As the presiding judge in the case of Craig Price, accused of 4 proven murders, I have ensured a fair and impartial trial by maintaining order and decorum in the courtroom throughout the proceedings.

**Maintaining Order and Decorum**

Throughout the trial, I have consistently reminded counsel and witnesses to refrain from outbursts, disruptions, and inappropriate behavior. I have also instructed the bailiff to remove any spectators who have failed to comply with courtroom rules and etiquette.

**Rulings on Evidence and Objections**

During the trial, I have made several key rulings on the admissibility of evidence and objections raised by counsel. Notably, I have:

* Allowed the prosecution's expert testimony on forensic evidence, finding it relevant and reliable.
* Excluded the defense's attempt to introduce character evidence, deeming it irrelevant and potentially prejudicial.
* Sustained the prosecution's objection to the defense's line of questioning, which was deemed leading and suggestive.

**Jury Instructions**

Prior to deliberation, I provided clear and comprehensive instructions to the jury on the applicable laws and their duty. Specifically, I instructed them on:

* The elements of the crimes charged, including the necessary intent and actus reus.
* The burden of proof, emphasizing that the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
* The importance of considering only the evidence presented in court and avoiding speculation or bias.

**Jury Verdict and Sentencing**

After deliberation, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all four counts of murder. In considering an appropriate sentence, I have taken into account the following key factors:

* The severity and brutality of the crimes committed.
* The defendant's lack of remorse and failure to accept responsibility.
* The impact of the crimes on the victims' families and the community at large.

Based on these factors, the court sentences the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on each count, to be served consecutively.

**Judgment**

In delivering this judgment, I am mindful of the gravity of the crimes committed and the need to ensure that justice is served. The evidence presented in court has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is responsible for the brutal murders of four innocent individuals. The sentence imposed reflects the seriousness of these crimes and the need to protect society from further harm.

Based on the overwhelming evidence and the defendant's culpability, the court sentences the defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on each count, to be served consecutively.
